# Fire_Incidents_Tableau
1) The dataset includes fire incident data as defined by Ontario Fire Marshal(OFM) up to December 31, 2021. 
This dataset provides detail on each fire incident, including incident location, station number, date and time, casualties occurred, fire control method used. The purpose of this report is to provide analysis and insights on incidents trend and pattern in Toronto over the time.

2) Dashboard 1:
This dashboard focuses on Toronto Fire department performance analysis based on latest of december 2021 data from Toronto open data catalogue. This dashboard helps in gaining key insights, below are potential graphs used to explore the data:
●	Geographical Map: A geographical map shows detail about incident count, civilian casualties and estimation dollar loss across the city. The highlighted dots show the municipality name and fire station name of nearby incident locations. The size of the dots in the geographical graph corresponds to the frequency of incidents in a given area, with larger dots indicating a higher incidence rate in that area. So, analysis says downtown region of toronto area has suffered more incidences (particularly station 426)
●	Heat Map: This shows the distribution of the count of incidents across the city by each day of the year, with darker areas representing a higher count of incidences. This helps to identify higher risk areas. 
●	Bar Graph: This shows Incident count by area of fire origin, depicts the origin areas of fire highlighting civilian casualties caused, count of persons rescued and estimated dollar loss due to the reason. With the analysis, indoor areas have more prone to fire accidents which means more awareness and fire safety needs to be done. 
This dashboard has a shared filter of year and month which enables it to drill down and view data based on the requirement.

3) Dashboard 2:
This dashboard focuses on Fire preventive measures and response time for Toronto Fire Incidents based on latest of december 2021 data from Toronto open data catalogue. This dashboard helps in gaining key insights, below are potential graphs used to explore the data:
●	Treemap: It shows the top ten ignition sources for the fire incidents that occurred based on the municipality area of Toronto city. Cooking equipment and indoor origins are the most common source of fire followed by smoking articles and electrical from vehicles.
●	Horizontal bar graph: This shows the status of fire when fire control team arrival and how they addressed the incidents, at the time time talk about person rescued, civilian and firefighters casualties. It helps in providing insight that fire got controlled even before the fire extinguisher team reached the location, this resulted in significant casualties count. This followed by fire incidents that occurred on streets where fire departments were able to control and lead to high firefighter casualty. 
●	Line graph: This graph talks about the trend of response time in minutes to the total count of incidents that occurred over years. It reveals shorter response time associated with maximum incident counts, indicating that efficiency and fire response play an important role in reducing incident count.
●	Stacked Bar graph: This graph shows the relative proportion of the civilian and firefighter casualty counts when fire alarm system was present versus when fire alarm not present. This indicates areas where fire alarm installations are required to be performed by the fire department.  
The common filter for this dashboard is based on the year, which can be modified as per the user's data requirements. The dashboard allows for flexibility in selecting the desired year, thus enabling the user to obtain relevant and accurate data.

●	The number of incidents has increased over the past decade indicating a need for greater investment in fire preventive measures and public awareness about fire safety. It also points out increased resources and firefighter personnel. 
●	The most common cause of fire is due to the cooking area or kitchen with top ignition sources for the fire incident cause is stove, range top-burner followed by the engine area, trash area, balcony which tells us that more indoor fire safety education is needed.
●	Major incidents are observed near the fire station of downtown toronto area (former) municipality which also depicts significant dollar loss particularly in this area and particularly low casualty number in comparison to the incident count shows the fire operation team being vigilant. 
●	There is strong correlation between number of incidents and response time, incidents with long response time had likelihood of resulting in severe consequences.
